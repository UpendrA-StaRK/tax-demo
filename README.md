# Unified Tax Calculation System


*A modern system for progressive tax calculations with multi-dimensional parameters and optimal deduction planning*

## Overview
The **Unified Tax Calculation System** is an advanced and efficient tax computation engine designed to handle progressive tax calculations with both static and dynamic tax slabs. It leverages multi-dimensional parameter analysis using KD-trees and optimizes tax deductions using an advanced knapsack solver. 

The system also features real-time updates with efficient O(log n) complexity for dynamic slab management. A **Streamlit GUI** is provided for user interaction, making tax computations straightforward and interactive.

## Features

- **📈 Progressive Tax Calculation** - Supports both static and dynamic tax slabs to accommodate various taxation models.
- **🌐 Multi-Dimensional Parameters** - Takes into account factors such as location, age, and other custom conditions using KD-trees for fast lookups.
- **💡 Deduction Optimization** - Implements an advanced knapsack algorithm to maximize tax savings through optimal deductions.
- **⚡ Real-Time Updates** - Utilizes efficient data structures for quick O(log n) updates in tax slab management.
- **📊 Streamlit GUI** - Provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the tax computation system.
- **🔍 AI-Powered Tax Suggestions** - Uses AI to recommend the best tax-saving strategies based on input data.
